# Robustness and Plasticity in Regulatory Networks

The BoolNetPerturb package adds functions to BoolNet for perturbing Boolean Regulatory Networks. This functions can be used for the study of biological systems. This package is capable of labeling states, simulating multiple knock-outs and over-expressions and simulating fixed and transient perturbations in the states and trajectory of a network. See the Jupyter Tutorials for more examples.

For the old version of boolnet go to https://github.com/mar-esther23/boolnet-perturb-0.1/

## Installation
Using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) in R:
```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("mar-esther23/boolnet-perturb")
```

You can see the [tutorials in github](https://github.com/mar-esther23/boolnet-perturb/tutorials). To run them you need [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) and the [Rkernel](http://irkernel.github.io/installation/).
